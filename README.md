# SpringSecureWallet


This repository contains a secure wallet application built with Spring Boot, utilizing JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication and authorization. The application allows users to manage their accounts, conduct transactions (deposits and withdrawals), and view their transaction history, all while ensuring data security and user privacy. With a focus on robust security practices, this project demonstrates the integration of JWT for secure API access, making it a perfect example for developers looking to implement secure transaction systems.
